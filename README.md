# Retail Solution Catalog Software Challenge

## Company Overview

We are a leading electronics company dedicated to revolutionizing the retail experience by seamlessly integrating our electronic devices with innovative software solutions. Our goal is to provide our clients with the tools they need to offer their customers an exceptional buying experience.

## Project Overview

As a member of our software team, you will collaborate closely with our electronics engineers to bridge the gap between our devices and real-world retail solutions. Your primary challenge will be to develop a robust catalog software application for a buying totem. This application will be a critical component of our retail solution, enhancing the shopping experience for users.

## Challenge Requirements

Your task is to design and implement a catalog software that meets the following specifications:

1. **Product Catalog**:
   - Display a comprehensive catalog of products with both small and large photos.
   - Each product should include a description, price, unit of measure, and weight.
   - Products should be organized into categories for easy navigation.

2. **User Identification**:
   - On first interaction, users should identify themselves using their document number.
   - The system will then display a list of available products tailored to the user.

3. **Navigation and Search**:
   - Users should be able to browse products by categories.
   - A search functionality should allow users to find products by name.

4. **Shopping Cart**:
   - Users should be able to add multiple products to their cart.
   - The cart should support the addition of any number of products.

5. **Checkout and Payment**:
   - Implement a streamlined checkout process.
   - Emulate the integration with a secure payment process.

6. **Integration Capabilities**:
   - The catalog software should be easily integrable with client APIs to fetch product data.
   - The software should interface with the client's ERP system to register payments.

## Collaboration with Electronics Team

- The electronics team will assist with the integration of the catalog software with POS machines and payment systems.
- For this challenge, you do not need to focus on the integration with the PINPAD SDK.

## Technical Requirements

- Ensure the software is user-friendly and provides a seamless experience on the totem.
- Maintain high standards of code quality and documentation to facilitate future maintenance and scalability.
- Provide a simple design explaining the backend and front-end interaction.
- Provide a software design of the solution.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Your submission will be evaluated based on the quality of frontend code and your knowledge about backend development.
- Provide a functional backend that supports the frontend demonstration.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the complete source code along with documentation explaining the architecture, setup instructions, and any dependencies.
- Include test cases to validate the functionality of key components.
- Include a software design of the solution, explaining the interaction between frontend and backend components.

We look forward to seeing your innovative solutions and how you can contribute to enhancing the retail experience for our clients. Good luck!
